#what is python?
""" Python is a popular programming language. 
It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991"""
"""Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a
 developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and 
then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed."""

"""Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.
 It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured 
 (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
  It is often described as a "batteries included"
 language due to its comprehensive standard library"""

 #why python(uses of python)
 """Python is a programming language that is widely used in
  web applications, software development, data science, and 
  machine learning (ML). Developers use Python because it is efficient 
  and easy to learn and can run on many different platforms.
   Python software is free to download, integrates
  well with all types of systems, and increases development speed."""


  #why python
  """
  Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way."""



#python comments
"""
Comments can be used to explain Python code.
Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

python follows two ways of comments
1.single line comments using # symbol
2.multi line comments using """""
